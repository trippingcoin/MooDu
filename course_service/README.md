**By:** Sanzhar M., Torekhan P., Miras T.

## Overview

In the era of education digitalization, the need for modern, user-friendly academic platforms is more urgent than ever. Existing platforms like **Moodle** and **Digital University (DU)** are essential, yet they present several usability and integration challenges.

**MooDu** is a proposed platform that merges the core functionalities of Moodle and DU while introducing enhanced features, streamlined design, and better user experience. MooDu aims to optimize the academic process for students, instructors, and administrative staff alike.

---

## Motivation

While Moodle is widely used for managing homework, grades, and exams, and DU provides critical academic information like transcripts and schedules, both platforms lack modern design and deeper integration. MooDu bridges this gap.

## Competitive Analysis

| Platform           | Strengths                                      | Weaknesses                                  |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Moodle**         | Robust assignment and grading tools           | Outdated UI, poor integration with DU       |
| **Digital University** | Administrative functions, academic records | Clunky interface, slow performance          |

**MooDu** will combine the best of these platforms while addressing their pain points.
